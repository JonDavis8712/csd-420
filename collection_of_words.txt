this is a test to see if it works
it works correctly
this test should pass all criteria
criteria met program functions as expected
expected output ascending descending
testing with a large number of words
large number of unique words
some words are repeated many times

this should stress the program a little
little stress program should handle
handle stress without issues
issues should not occur during processing
processing large file of words
words in the file are a mix
mix of short and long words
long words should be handled correctly too
too many words to count easily
easily we can say there are hundreds
hundreds of words in this collection
collection is designed for thorough testing
thorough testing is important for quality
quality software is the goal
goal achieved through careful testing
careful testing and attention to detail
detail is important in programming
programming requires precision
precision leads to correct output
output should match expectations
expectations are clear ascending descending
descending then ascending order
order of words is important
important to get it right
right output is the aim
aim for perfect execution
execution without errors
errors should be caught and handled
handled gracefully by the program
program should be robust
robust and reliable for all inputs
inputs from the file are processed
processed to find unique words
unique words then sorted and displayed
displayed in the required order
order is crucial for the assignment
assignment requirements must be met
met with a working and tested program
program that works and is tested well
well tested code is good code
good code is the final objective
objective reached successfully.
